# Vehicle Rental Platform â€“ Microservices System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The Vehicle Rental Platform is a microservices-based system designed to provide a seamless experience for users looking to rent vehicles. The system allows users to browse available vehicles, view prices, and make reservations based on availability and location.

The solution follows the principles of **Clean Architecture**, ensuring:
- Business logic is independent of frameworks, databases, or delivery mechanisms.
- Each microservice is a standalone unit with clear, defined responsibilities.
- Dependencies point inward from infrastructure towards the core domain.

Users need an efficient and reliable way to:
- View available vehicles based on time, location, and preferences.
- Make a reservation for a chosen vehicle.
- Manage their reservations and personal data.

Administrators need the ability to:
- Add, edit, or remove vehicles from the system.
- Manage reservations made by users.
